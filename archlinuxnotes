*** ISO ***
1.  Download ISO
2.  Use Rufus (on windows) to burn the ISO to USB

*** Verify Boot Mode ***
1.  Run "ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars"
2.  If there is no output, your computer is using BIOS and later you'll use MBR for boot.  All of mine have been MBR so far (7/15/2018)


*** Connect to the Internet ***
1.  Installation image enables dhcpcd for wired devices on boot.  You'll have to do this on your own once you install!!!
2.  ping archlinux.org, 8.8.8.8, and/or jeff-hammond.com

*** Update System Clock ***
1.  timedatectl set-ntp true
2.  Check service status with "timedatectl status"


*** Partition the Disk(s) ***
1.  use "fdisk -l" or "lsblk" to view disks.  Results ending in rom, loop or airoot may be ignored.
  a.  Note: One partition is required for the root directory.  This may be your only partition.
2.  My devices will use MBR (Master Boot Record) because I have a BIOS motherboard.
3.  "fdisk /dev/sda" or generically "fdisk /dev/sdX"
4.  Be sure to delete all partitions before creating a new one.
  a.  If you create a new one and you're not asked "primary/extended", your old partition isn't deleted
  b.  Type should end up being...83? for Linux
5.  Be sure to make the file system--"mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1" 

*** Mount File System ***
1.  "mount /dev/sda1 /mnt"
2.  "pacstrap /mnt base" and any other packages desired after "base"


*** Generate fstab File ***
1.  "genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab"
  a.  The fstab(5) file can be used to define how disk partitions, various other block devices, or remote filesystems should be mounted into the filesystem. 

****** Change Root into the New System ******
1.  "arch-chroot /mnt"

*** Time Zone ***
1.  ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Americas/Chicago /etc/localtime
2.  "hwclock --systohc"

*** Network Config ***
1.  Create hostname file
  a.  /etc/hostname
    i.  myhostname
2.  /etc/hosts
  a.  127.0.0.1 localhost
  b.  ::1 localhost
  c.  127.0.1.1 myhostname.localdomain myhostname
  
*** Network (Wired Connection) troubleshooting ***
where "eth0" is the name of device/connection found on running "ip link"
systemctl enable dhcpcd@eth0.service
systemctl start dhcpcd@eth0.service

*** Set Root Password ***
1.  "passwd"

*** Boot Loader ***
NOTE: I use GRUB.  These instructions detail that
1.  If you have intel PC, run "Pacman -S intel-ucode"
2.  Run "grub-install --target=i386-pc /dev/sda"
  i.  My PC is X86_64, but the i386-pc will recognize this and load the 64-big correctly
3.  *** Try to edit the /etc/default/grub file and change GRUB_TIMEOUT=5 to GRUB_TIMEOUT=0.  This prevents annoying load screen
4.  Run "grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg".  If step 3 wasn't possible, run grub-mkconfig, set values, then run it again.

type "exit"
****** Exit Change Root ******

Enter in "umount -R /mnt" to umount

type "reboot"
