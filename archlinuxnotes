*** ISO ***
1.  Download ISO
2.  Use Rufus (on windows) to burn the ISO to USB

*** Verify Boot Mode ***
1.  Run "ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars"
2.  If there is no output, your computer is using BIOS and later you'll use MBR for boot.  All of mine have been MBR so far (7/15/2018)


*** Connect to the Internet ***
1.  Installation image enables dhcpcd for wired devices on boot.  You'll have to do this on your own once you install!!!
2.  ping archlinux.org, 8.8.8.8, and/or jeff-hammond.com

*** Update System Clock ***
1.  timedatectl set-ntp true
2.  Check service status with "timedatectl status"


*** Partition the Disk(s) ***
1.  use "fdisk -l" or "lsblk" to view disks.  Results ending in rom, loop or airoot may be ignored.
  a.  Note: One partition is required for the root directory.  This may be your only partition.
2.  My devices will use MBR (Master Boot Record) because I have a BIOS motherboard.
3.  "fdisk /dev/sda" or generically "fdisk /dev/sdX"
4.  




Network (Wired Connection) troubleshooting:

where "eth0" is the name of device/connection found on running "ip link"
